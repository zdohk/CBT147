//*           Modification note:                                    *   FILE 147
//*                                                                 *   FILE 147
//*            Modified slightly by Rob Prins, (Version 6.1.2)      *   FILE 147
//*            The reason was that ARCHIVER was traditionally       *   FILE 147
//*            meant to be used in batch.  However, Rob, who is     *   FILE 147
//*            the author of RPF (Rob's Programming Facility -      *   FILE 147
//*            CBT File 415) wanted RPF to interactively be able    *   FILE 147
//*            to access and modify an Archive.  He found that      *   FILE 147
//*            some LOAD macros were not matched by corresponding   *   FILE 147
//*            DELETE macros, etc., plus a few other errors,        *   FILE 147
//*            which didn't show up when the ARCHIVER was run in    *   FILE 147
//*            batch.  These were fixed here.                       *   FILE 147
//*            Another modification is intruducing an EXEC PARM     *   FILE 147
//*            By specifying 'PARM=SYSIN=ddname1,SYSPRINT=ddname2'  *   FILE 147
//*            you can override the standard ddnames for SYSIN and  *   FILE 147
//*            SYSPRINT. If you omit the PARM the standard ddnames  *   FILE 147
//*            SYSIN and SYSPRINT are used.                         *   FILE 147
//*           ---------------------------------------------------   *   FILE 147
//*                                                                 *   FILE 147
//*           "The ARCHIVER" is a handy mechanism to store all of   *   FILE 147
//*           your software and data objects--source code, load     *   FILE 147
//*           modules, PSF objects, and the like--in one place,     *   FILE 147
//*           in a single VSAM cluster.  Version 4.0 and higher     *   FILE 147
//*           of The ARCHIVER provide a large amount of data        *   FILE 147
//*           compression, especially for source code.  Version     *   FILE 147
//*           4.0 and higher of "The ARCHIVER" allows item-by-item  *   FILE 147
//*           "export" to tape.  From the tape we can go directly   *   FILE 147
//*           back to pds uncompressed form, without need for the   *   FILE 147
//*           intermediate VSAM cluster.  Version 5.0 of The        *   FILE 147
//*           ARCHIVER was extensively reworked from previous       *   FILE 147
//*           versions.  Files created with previous versions of    *   FILE 147
//*           "The ARCHIVER" are upgradable with the "CONVERT"      *   FILE 147
//*           command.  Rick Fochtman plans to keep "The ARCHIVER"  *   FILE 147
//*           upwardly compatible.                                  *   FILE 147
//*                                                                 *   FILE 147
//*           Version 6.1 of The ARCHIVER is basically a            *   FILE 147
//*           Y2K-ization of Version 5.0.  (Remember here that      *   FILE 147
//*           the general CBT disclaimer about Y2K compatibility    *   FILE 147
//*           being "not guaranteed" applies - SG 10/12/99.)        *   FILE 147
