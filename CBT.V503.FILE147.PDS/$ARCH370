ARCHIVER Version 6 for MVS3.8J by Dave Cartwright.

I have long been a fan of The Archiver program from Rick Fochtman - see
CBT file 172 for some add-ons I did for Version 5 (I have not tried
these with Version 6).  When the requirement arose in AGCO UK Ltd. to
archive a home-grown IMS application that was being replaced with
shrink-wrap software I looked to the Archiver as a suitable tool.
One point about an archive is that you should be able to read it; not
just the recording medium, but the playback technology as well. At the
time I was taking part in the beta test of the MVS Turnkey #3 from
Volker Bandke (http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/). It seemed to me that this met
the requirements of an archiving system; it was freely available,
portable, not subject to copyright etc.. There was even a copy of The
Archiver on the Turnkey system (CBT429.FILE147). Unfortunately when I
tried to install that version I found it was not downwards compatible to
MVS/370.  Rick kindly allowed me to create a downwards compatible
version and this document describes that program.
There were some minor problems with the Assembler that I fixed by moving
some statements to a different location.  Module RPARSE has RMODE/AMODE
statements that cause errors which may be ignored.
The biggest problem was the use of a Y2K compliant version of the TIME
macro in ARCHINIT. To overcome this I have created a version called
A370INIT that programs around the functions that IBM now provide in the
TIME macro. I used code from GETDATE by Jim Marshall as the basis for
this work. The code is pretty sloppy and I have a very cavalier attitude
towards using data areas for scratch pads, but it works. It is upwards
compatible; you may use this version under OS/390 or z/OS if you wish.
Member $INST370 is the jobstream to install this program using Assembler
F under MVS/370.
